This is an example blog post written in MDX. You can write in simple markdown syntax and include all the features you need.

## Writing in MDX

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. Here's what you can do:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even ~~strikethrough~~.

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a [link](https://feelinmoody.io)

And an ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote. Perfect for highlighting important passages or quotes from others.

### Links

You can link to [your Substack](https://hankcmoody.substack.com), [feelinmoody.io](https://feelinmoody.io), or any external resource.

## Adding Images

To add images, place them in the `/public` folder and reference them like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)
```

## Adding Videos

You can embed YouTube videos or other embeds by using HTML:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

## Next Steps

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `/content/writings/`
2. Add the frontmatter with title, subtitle, date, and optional substackUrl
3. Write your content in markdown
4. Save the file and it will automatically appear on your site

That's it! Your blog post is now live on your site and accessible at `/writings/example-post`.
